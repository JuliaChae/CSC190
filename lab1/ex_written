Plotted specified functions on MATLAB (unsure how to submit file).
Observed that polynomials with greater power increase more quickly than polynomials with less power after a certain point, to infinity 
Exponential functions end up increasing at a faster rate than polynomials after a certain point -> for large numbers
Logarithmic functions increase very slowly for big numbers 
Linear functions increase at a constant rate 
Linear logarithmic functions appear to increase at a linear rate for big numbers
