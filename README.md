# CSC190
This repository contains labs for U of T's CSC190 (Algorithms and Data Structures) course. The assignments are coded in Python and C. 

## Lab Overview
**Lab 1**  Part A: Program a stack in C using linked lists and write a Parenthesis Checking algorithm that reads in an expression and determines whether the brackets are properly balanced or not  
Part B: Write an implementation of a stack data structure in Python

**Lab 2**  Implement a tree and binary tree class & level order traversal algorithm. Code two converting functions which convert tree to binary tree and vise versa. 

**Lab 3**  Write a tree sorting algorithm which sorts a set of numbers by reading them into a binary search tree and printing out in order traversal. Program the AVL Tree and program rotation functions.

**Lab 4**  Part A: Program the heap data structure in C 
Part B: Program hash functions and tables in Python  

**Lab 5**  Program a graph class in Python which includes add vertex, add edge , traverse and connectivity functionalities  

**Lab 6**  Part A: Program a Pseudo-random number generator using bit manipulation in C
Part B: Write an encryption and decryption program using bit manipulation in C

**Lab 7**  Implement selection, heap, merge and quick sort algorithms in Python

**Lab 8**  Write a parametrized bubble sort algorithm in C which takes the array, size of the array and the comparison function as arguments. Implement heap and radix sort in C. 

**Lab 9**  Program quick sort and tower of hanoi in Python
